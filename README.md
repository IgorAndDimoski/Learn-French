# Learn-French
Learn French language with my Flash Card App.
This is interesting way how to learn French, try it out and let me know in the comments what is your favorite word in French. Mine is FR "revoir" EN "meet again"
Here we can see how we can make a beautifull functionality combinations using GUI TkInter and Pandas. I love pandas, because pandas documentation is very neat, well organized, easy to work with.
As you run the app GUI Tkinter pops up, and now you have a word in French showing up and then after 6 sec the card will be flipped and the same word will be revealed on English.
If you already know that word, you can click on YES button and that will remove that word from your list_to_learn. On the otherhand if you click NO that indicates that you don't know yet that word,
and still will be at you list_to_learn. 
Further on, in both cases YES or NO after you click a new word appears and so on...
